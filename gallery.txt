Nothwood in fall: the site of the Northwood Apartment in fall. Many leaves fell on the ground, stuck to the shoes and were taken into the house.

Nightfall at the main campus: the colorful sky as nightfall approaches. It made ones feel relaxed after studying.

Sunset at Michigan: another picture of nightfall.

Michigan Football Field: first time to watch a football game in Michigan! The atomosphere was very warm and people were making lots of noise. I did not know American football much, but I still got excited when entering the stadium. It was very interesting to get involved one of the biggest sport events in Ann Arbor. After a long suspension, it was great to see people gather together again as a family.

Michigan wins! Yayyy!

Barton Pond at night: beautiful moonlight. I went to Barton Pond to admire the moon around mid-autumn. It was dark and quiet, except the sounds of the waterflow. It was pretty appealing to take a photo of moon above the small waterfall. The moon, the lake and the houses on the other shore created a fascinating picture. My friends and I decided to go there again in winter to watch the snow.

Galaxy and stars seen at Barton Pond: the Big Dipper. The stars could be clearly seen because Barton Pond was far away from the city and there was no human light there. I could easily find the Big Dipper. It was great to find a place to watch stars near the place we live and study. Hopefully in the future I can have a chance to explore the universe.

Small lake at Whisperwood Drive: the ducks on it were very cute!

Abundant lunch: first lunch made by my friends and me after arriving at Ann Arbor.
