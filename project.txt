This is a song recommendation system based on self-built hadoop and Spark. My teammates and I built a small hadoop clusters connecting five computers by ourselves. Then we configured Spark on it. We used it to develop a song recommendation system with the Million Song Dataset. The size of the dataset we used was about 100GB. 

With the US Educational Finances and US Household Income Statistics datasets, I explored the relationship between education investment and household income in the US. I found that in most states high investment leads to high household income. However, there were some states with high investment having low household income as well. After further research, it turned out that these states could have a brain drain problem. Highly educated people tend to move out of these states and go to more prosperous cities.

This is a information retrieval system that is able to provide search results with respect to a user-specified readability level. The English levels of different people are different so people probably want to read the texts they can understand without difficulties. Besides, it is also meaningful for second language learners if they can specify readability level when searching. The system is composed of a readability classifier and a search engine. Both of them are trained on a deep learning network.
